## What's this course about and how is it different?

100 days of code is not just about the commitment. The true power and effectiveness is in having a guide and pursuing the "right-sized" projects. That’s why we have 33 deeply practical projects. Each paired with 20-40 minute lessons at the beginning of the project.

Just a small sampling of the projects you’ll work on include:
